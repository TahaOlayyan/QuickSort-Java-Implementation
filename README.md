# Quick Sort Algorithm 🚀

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the **Divide and Conquer** strategy.  
It works by selecting a **pivot** element, then partitioning the array into two parts:
- Elements smaller than the pivot
- Elements greater than the pivot

This process is repeated recursively until the whole array is sorted.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Fast and efficient** for large datasets
- **In-place sorting** (requires minimal extra memory)
- **Based on recursion and partitioning**

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Case        | Complexity   |
|-------------|-------------|
| Best        | O(n log n)  |
| Average     | O(n log n)  |
| Worst       | O(n²)       |

## 📌 How It Works (Steps)
1. Choose a pivot
2. Partition elements around the pivot
3. Recursively sort left and right partitions
